* **1.1 Create your Telegram Bot**

Telegram allows you to easily create your own Bot with the help of **@BotFather**.

Use the **/newbot** command to create a new bot. 

The **BotFather** will ask you for a name and username, then generate an **authorization token** for your new bot.

The name of your bot is displayed in contact details and elsewhere.

The Username is a short name, to be used in mentions and telegram.me links. Usernames are 5-32 characters long and are case insensitive, but may only include Latin characters, numbers, and underscores. 

Your bot's username must end in ‘bot’, e.g. ‘_tetris_bot_’ or ‘_TetrisBot_’.

The token is a string along the lines of **HTTP API** that is required to authanticate. Copy that token and pass it to .env file.
